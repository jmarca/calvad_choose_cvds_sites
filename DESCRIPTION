Title: Code to help solve where to put new classifying VDS sites
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "James Marca <james@activiemtrics.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package will help solve the problem of where to site
             new classifying  VDS detectors.  The problem is viewed as
             a set covering problem.  Each WIM station can "cover" a
             number of VDS stations (as determined by a distance
             parameter).  The stations that *aren't* covered by the
             existing WIM stations need the new classifying VDS
             stations, or their truck estimation solutions will be weak.
